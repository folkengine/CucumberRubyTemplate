Feature: Is there there there?

  This is a basic Cucumber Template for working
  with Cucumber inside IntelliJ with the Ruby Plugin.
  Based upon Gertrude Stein's quote about Oakland:

  "She took us to see her granddaughter who was
  teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael,
  we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not
  changed but Goat Island might just as well not have
  been there, anyway what was the use of my having
  come from Oakland it was not natural to have come
  from there yes write about it if I like or anything
  if I like but not there, there is no there there."

  Scenario: They are in Oakland
    Given someone is there
    When they are in oakland,
    Then there is no there there.

  Scenario: They are not in Oakland
    Given someone is there
    When they are in Cleveland,
    Then there is there there.
